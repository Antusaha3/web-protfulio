        <p>Brahmos implements the known React APIs (hooks, context, concurrent mode, and more) with a different and potentially faster method that also leverages a standard feature of JavaScript: template literals. Brahmos is among the very few UI frameworks that implements the experimental concurrent mode API sponsored by React. Other frameworks may be waiting out, or discarding the feature entirely. </p>
